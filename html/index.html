        <h3>About WikiVis</h3>
        <p>
          With how data is seen in every facet of life ranging from the connection between Twitch 
          streamers to the amount of showers each CS major partakes in, we hope to create a 
          visualization that allows everyday people to see those connections and create something 
          beautiful from it. There exist many areas where data can be used but one interesting data 
          visualization which we have not seen is the connection between Wikipedia articles. Inspired 
          by games like Wikirace, we are creating a new way, more beautiful to visualize data. And 
          hey, what if we make it crazier and overlay these connections on a 3 dimensional plane?
        </p>
        <p>
          All you have to do is enter the title of the Wikipedia article you are interested in (case 
          sensitive) and click the Visualize button. Then you'll see a graph of articles visualized as 
          spherical nodes, all of which are connected based on how the articles are linked. You can
          rotate the graph and navigate between nodes using the arrow keys as well.
